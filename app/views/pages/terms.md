# Terms of Use

This page is licensed under a Peer Production License, which permits reuse exclusively for non-commercial and worker-owned enterprises.

## Section 1. Welcome

Welcome to the jam.coop Terms of Use! In this document, we do our best to avoid too much legal language and make this as understandable as possible. We believe that terms of use should be fair, transparent, and easy to understand.

## Section 2. Acceptance of Terms of Use

The following terms and conditions govern your use of the jam.coop website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by Go Free Range Ltd. (“jam.coop,” “we,” or “us”). You are agreeing to these legally binding terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) by signing up or otherwise using the Services, or accessing any content or material that is made available by jam.coop through the Service.

## Section 3. Changes to Terms of Use

jam.coop may, from time to time, make changes to the Terms of Use in consultation with the Worker-Owners and Artist-Owners of jam.coop. All changes that are made to the Terms of Use are effective immediately.

Once a change is made, we will provide you with a prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. We may display a prominent notice on the Services or by sending you an email, or both. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been made will constitute your continued acceptance of these terms and the changes.

We encourage you to read any changes carefully.

## Section 4. The jam.coop Platform

### Section 4a. An Artist's Intellectual Property

#### Artist Intellectual Property

Artists should only post things they have permission or a license to post. jam.coop does not own content Artists submit to us (the “Content”). Artists keep ownership of what they post on jam.coop. However, jam.coop does need certain licenses from artists in order to perform our Services. When Artists create an Artist Page, or post content, they agree to these terms:

Artists are responsible for all of their activity in connection with the Service. For purposes of these Terms of Use, the term “Content” includes, without limitation, any videos, audio clips, written comments, information, data, text, photographs, graphics, provided, or otherwise made accessible by the Artist on or through the Service.

By way of example, and not as a limitation, Artists shall not (and shall not permit any third party to) either (a) take any action or (b) upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any content on or through the Service, that: infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any other person or entity or violates any law or contractual duty.

Artists must own, control, or be authorized to distribute everything they upload. That means Artists cannot post covers, unless they have a written license or authorization from the owner of said material to upload the cover to the Service and grant us the rights in the terms below. Artist Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless the Artist has permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material (and to grant jam.coop all the license rights outlined here). Any royalties or licensing on Artist Content is the responsibility of the Artist. Artists will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on the Content, or on jam.coop's hosting of that Content.

Artists warrant that the rights of any third-party are not being violated should jam.coop use the Content. If jam.coop or its users exploit or make use of your submission in the ways contemplated in this agreement, Artists promise that this will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including (without limitation) any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

Artists are responsible for the stuff you post. All information submitted to the Site, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person
from whom that content originated.

jam.coop is not responsible for mistakes in your content. jam.coop will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content.

jam.coop can use the content you've submitted. For the purposes of marketing, you grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right to use, exercise, and commercialize the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights with respect to your Content.

When we use the content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it. You grant us the right to edit, modify, reformat, excerpt, delete, or translate any of your Content.

### Section 4b. jam.coop's Intellectual Property

You agree to respect all copyright, trademark, patent, and other legal notices, information, and restrictions contained in any content accessed through the Site or Service. You also agree not to change, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of the Service or Site.

jam.coop grants the User a license to reproduce content from the Services for personal use only. This license covers both our own protected content and Artist-generated content on the Site. This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable. If you want to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial purpose, you need prior written permission from jam.coop or the relevant copyright holder. A “commercial purpose” means you intend to use, sell, license, rent, or otherwise exploit content for commercial use, in any way.

### Section 4c. Other Websites

jam.coop may contain links to other websites. (For instance, artist pages, user profiles, and comments may link to outside sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We do not control or endorse those sites. jam.coop partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing. When you make a purchase, you are also agreeing to the payment processor's terms of use and service.

### Section 4d. Rights Reserved to jam.coop

jam.coop reserves these rights:

- To make changes to the jam.coop Site and Services without notice or liability.
- To decide eligibility to use jam.coop. jam.coop can cancel accounts or decline to offer our Services, especially following abuse of account privileges. jam.coop may change eligibility criteria at any time.
- To reject, interrupt, remove, or suspend any Artist page at any time and for any reason.

jam.coop is not liable for any damages as a result of any of these actions.

## Section 5. Account Management

### Section 5a. Creating an Account

To create an account you represent that you are 1) the age of majority in your jurisdiction (usually 18), or 2) are over the age of 13 and have the express permission of a legal guardian to obtain an account and to use the Services connected with the account. Do not pretend you are someone else. You are responsible for all the activity on your account. You can browse jam.coop without registering for an account. But to create an Artist page, you will need to register, choose a username, and set a password. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Do not impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive in any way deemed as such by jam.coop. If you do not follow these rules, jam.coop may cancel your account.

You are responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential. If you find out that someone has compromised your account without your permission, you should report it to contact@jam.coop.

### Section 5b. Deleting an Account.

You can terminate your account at any time by contacting us at contact@jam.coop. We may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes. All provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content you've already submitted to the Site. You can contact us at contact@jam.coop for additional information or to request an artist page deletion.

### The Rest

These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and jam.coop with respect to the Services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and jam.coop with respect to the Services and govern our future relationship. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either you or jam.coop to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won't be deemed a waiver of any other rights.

These Terms are personal to you. You can't assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get jam.coop's prior written consent. jam.coop has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent. jam.coop will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.
