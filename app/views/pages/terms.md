# Terms of Use

This work is licensed under a Peer Production License, which permits reuse exclusively for non-commercial and worker-owned enterprises.

## Section 1. Welcome and Cooperative's Objectives

Welcome to the Ampled Terms of Use! In this document, we do our best to avoid too much legal language and make this as understandable as possible. We believe that terms of use should be fair, transparent, and easy to understand. We've included simple explanations like this in the document and also some cartoons. The explanations in quotes and cartoons are not part of the official legal terms.

## Section 2. Acceptance of Terms of Use

The following terms and conditions govern your use of this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by Ampled, LLC. (“Ampled,” “we,” or “us”). You are agreeing to these legally binding terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) by signing up or otherwise using the Services, or accessing any content or material that is made available by Ampled through the Service. You are also agreeing to our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Community Guidelines.

## Section 3. Changes to Terms of Use

Ampled may, from time to time, make changes to the Terms of Use in consultation with the Worker-Owners and Artist-Owners of Ampled. All changes that are made to the Terms of Use are effective immediately.

Once a change is made, we will provide you with a prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. We may display a prominent notice on the Services or by sending you an email, or both. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been made will constitute your continued acceptance of these terms and the changes.

We encourage you to read any changes carefully.

## Section 4. The Ampled Platform

Ampled is a platform that allows community users to support their favorite music artists with monthly recurring payments.

### Section 4a. How Artist Support Works

You agree to the following by supporting an Artist:
- You are doing so because you want to support an artist or artist(s), not because you expect something in return.
- Artists owe their supporters a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to setting good faith expectations for supporters. However, Ampled does not guarantee that Artists deliver content or work.
- When you support an artist, you will be charged on the monthly anniversary of the date of your initial support. (i.e. If you make a supporting payment on March 1 st then you will be billed again on April 1st.) If you support multiple artists, you will be charged monthly on the date that each artist was initially supported.

#### Payment Processing Fees

To process payments, we use Stripe Connect, which charges $0.30 + 2.9% per successful card charge. We take processing payments to Artists seriously - and using Stripe allows us to do this in a secure, safe, and compliant way. This fee is added to the subtotal for supporting an artist and is paid by the supporter. Supporters may view the total amount charged per artist per month by logging in, going to “My Profile” and viewing “Supporting Artists”. Supporters may cancel their support for an artist at any time. Ampled does not offer refunds and Ampled cannot guarantee that Artists' generate work.

### Section 4b. An Artist's Intellectual Property

#### Artist Intellectual Property

Artists should only post things they have permission or a license to post. Ampled does not own content Artists submit to us (the “Content”). Artists keep ownership of what they post on Ampled. However, Ampled does need certain licenses from artists in order to perform our Services. When Artists create an Artist Page, or post content, they agree to these terms:

Artists are responsible for all of their activity in connection with the Service. For purposes of these Terms of Use, the term “Content” includes, without limitation, any videos, audio clips, written comments, information, data, text, photographs, graphics, provided, or otherwise made accessible by the Artist on or through the Service.

By way of example, and not as a limitation, Artists shall not (and shall not permit any third party to) either (a) take any action or (b) upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any content on or through the Service, that: infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any other person or entity or violates any law or contractual duty.

Artists must own, control, or be authorized to distribute everything they upload. That means Artists cannot post covers, unless they have a written license or authorization from the owner of said material to upload the cover to the Service and grant us the rights in the terms below. Artist Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless the Artist has permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material (and to grant Ampled all the license rights outlined here). Any royalties or licensing on Artist Content is the responsibility of the Artist. Artists will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on the Content, or on Ampled's hosting of that Content.

Artists warrant that the rights of any third-party are not being violated should Ampled use the Content. If Ampled or its users exploit or make use of your submission in the ways contemplated in this agreement, Artists promise that this will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including (without limitation) any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

Artists are responsible for the stuff you post. All information submitted to the Site, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person
from whom that content originated.

Ampled is not responsible for mistakes in your content. Ampled will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content.

Ampled can use the content you've submitted. For the purposes of marketing, you grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right to use, exercise, and commercialize the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights with respect to your Content.

When we use the content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it. You grant us the right to edit, modify, reformat, excerpt, delete, or translate any of your Content.

### Section 4c. Ampled's Intellectual Property

You agree to respect all copyright, trademark, patent, and other legal notices, information, and restrictions contained in any content accessed through the Site or Service. You also agree not to change, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of the Service or Site.

Ampled grants the User/Supporter a license to reproduce content from the Services for personal use only. This license covers both our own protected content and Artist-generated content on the Site. This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable. If you want to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial purpose, you need prior written permission from Ampled or the relevant copyright holder. A “commercial purpose” means you intend to use, sell, license, rent, or otherwise exploit content for commercial use, in any way.

### Section 4d. Other Websites

Ampled may contain links to other websites. (For instance, artist pages, user profiles, and comments may link to outside sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We do not control or endorse those sites. Ampled partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing. When you support an artist, you are also agreeing to the payment processor's terms of use and service.

### Section 4e. Rights Reserved to Ampled

Ampled reserves these rights:

- To make changes to the Ampled Site and Services without notice or liability.
- To decide eligibility to use Ampled. Ampled can cancel accounts or decline to offer our Services, especially following abuse of account privileges. Ampled may change eligibility criteria at any time.
- To cancel any Artist support, at any time, and for any reason.
- To reject, interrupt, remove, or suspend any Artist page at any time and for any reason.

Ampled is not liable for any damages as a result of any of these actions.

## Section 5. Account Management

### Section 5a. Creating an Account

To create an account you represent that you are 1) the age of majority in your jurisdiction (usually 18), or 2) are over the age of 13 and have the express permission of a legal guardian to obtain an account and to use the Services connected with the account. Do not pretend you are someone else. You are responsible for all the activity on your account. You can browse Ampled without registering for an account. But to create an Artist page or support an Artist page, you will need to register, choose a username, and set a password. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Do not impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive in any way deemed as such by Ampled. If you do not follow these rules, Ampled may cancel your account.
You are responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential. If you find out that someone has compromised your account without your permission, you should report it to hello@ampled.com.

### Section 5b. Deleting an Account.

You can terminate your account at any time through your account settings. We may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes. All provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content you've already submitted to the Site. (For instance, if you've launched a project, deleting your account will not automatically remove the project from the Site.) You can contact us at hello@ampled.com for additional information or to request an artist page deletion.
