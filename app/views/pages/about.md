# About

## What is jam.coop?

jam.coop is a new online service that allows musicians
to connect with and sell music directly to their fans.

We plan to have features similar to other services,
such as Bandcamp, but with a crucial difference: jam.coop is a
co-operative run by and for the benefit of musicians and the people
who build the platform. We're not for sale and never will be.

## Who runs jam.coop?

jam.coop is built by a small software development company called [Go Free Range](https://gofreerange.com). We're a company owned and run by our workers - a worker co-operative.

We have experience of building this kind of thing. We helped build [FutureLearn](https://futurelearn.com), an online marketplace for
mass-participation university courses and [BBC Introducing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/introducing) a service for
musicians to upload their music to the BBC and get it played on the
radio.

## Who owns jam.coop?

jam.coop is owned by Go Free Range and we haven't taken on any external funding. Our vision, if we can build something successful, is to "exit to the community". jam.coop will become a multi-stakeholder co-operative owned and democratically run by
musicians, the workers at Go Free Range and any other staff we may
need to take on in the future.

We want to start small and move quickly. We're "incubating" this new co-operative within Go Free Range to begin with. We're covering the costs of development and infrastructure so that we can build something useful to musicians as quickly as possible. If we can get to the point where jam.coop is self-funding we'll be in a great place to "exit to the community". We're already working with advisors from [Principal Six Co-op](https://www.uk.coop/directory/principle-six) on how the new co-op will be structured.

## When will you be ready?

We're busy building the first, simplest version of jam.coop.

Here's a sketch of our roadmap:

### Building now

- Artist pages so fans can find your music
- [Album pages](/artists/under-shaded-trees/albums/1858) so fans can listen to your music
- Transcoding services so your music is available to download in MP3 and FLAC formats
- Credit card processing so fans can buy your music and download it to their devices

### Building next

- Collection pages so fans can listen to their purchases in one place
- Follow features so fans can be notified of your news and new releases
- Support for merchandise and physical sales
- Support for record labels

## How much do musicians earn?

To cover the costs of running and building jam.coop a 15% fee is taken from each sale (in addition to processing fees charged by our payment processor Stripe.

We're not sure what the best fee structure will be in the longer term - we need to balance sustainability, speed of development and fairness. We'll be entirely transparent about our finances and involve musicians and workers in the decision of how to set these fees.

## Where does the profit go?

If jam.coop makes a profit we will distribute that to musicians and workers using a formula we all agree on. We don't want to get ahead of
ourselves here, we're a long way from making a profit yet. But for
inspiration [Stocksy](https://share.stocksy.com/patronage-2021),
a stock photo co-operative owned by photographers and workers paid out
a substantial patronage dividend to its photographers in 2021. That's
where we'd like to get to.

## How do I sell my music on jam.coop?

We'd love to have you!

We want to provide a personal service to our first musicians so that we can work out exactly what you need. If you are an adventurous early-adopter and don't mind some rough edges, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@jam.coop).

## Is jam.coop open-source?

Not yet. Running a successful open source project requires a lot of time and we can't do that and build jam.coop at the same time at the moment. When we "exit to community" we will open-source the code. And if we ever have to shut down jam.coop, we'll open-source it too.

## I have another question!

Great! [Drop us a line](mailto:contact@jam.coop) or chat to Chris
