## Financial Report January 2024

Our artists sold £125.50 of digital downloads in January. We paid out £106.68 after deducting our platform fee of 15% (keeping £18.82).

We've been using [Wise](https://wise.com/gb/pricing/) to pay our artists and they take a fee depending on the location of the artist. Wise fees added up to £1.78 in total for January.

We incur some costs to run jam.coop. [Render](https://render.com) where we run 2 servers (one for the website, one for background jobs) and a database cost £53.39 in January. We paid [postmark](https://postmark.com) £11.90 for sending emails, and AWS $9.76 for S3 storage of artists music and bandwidth for streaming and downloads. Stripe also charged us around £8 in fees for credit card processing.

James and I logged 30 hours work on the project in January. As you can see above, we're not making enough in platform fees to cover the running costs currently, so that work remains unpaid for now. Go Free Range continues to cover the excess running costs.

10 different Artists sold music on jam.coop in January which is very exciting for us. We had 34 new artists creating accounts in January and 51 albums created.
