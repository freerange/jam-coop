Hey folks!

It's been a while since we sent out some updates about
[jam.coop](<%= root_url %>) and we've added a few new features for you
to try out. Read on!

## What is jam.coop?

jam.coop is an online record store owned co-operatively by musicians and
the people who work here. Owning it together means we can rely on it and
share in the profits together. We've answered some common questions at
[jam.coop/about](<%= about_url %>).

## Tagging your music

Artists can now tag their music. We support the same set of genre tags
that [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/genres) use, but soon we'll
let artists add their own too.

If you're an artist, head to your [account
dashboard](<%= account_url %>), edit your albums and tag away.
Make atmospheric sludge metal? We've got your back.

We'll wait a little while until we have some more music tagged, and
then make it easier for people to find music using them. You can get a
little peak by following the links on album pages, for example
<<%= tag_url('ambient') %>>.

## Licensing your music

We now make it easy to choose a license for your music, for example the
Attribution-NoDerivatives Creative Commons license.

By default everything is "All rights reserved" so if you're an artist
there's no need to change anything.

## More metadata in your downloads

If you buy music on jam, and we'd love it if you did, the downloaded
files now have a bunch of useful metadata (e.g. proper track numbering,
release dates) so that they look great wherever you play them.

## ATOM FEEDS

You heard us. Keep up with the latest releases on jam like it's 2005
with our [Albums Atom feed](<%= albums_url(format: 'atom') %>).

We love feeds, so expect artist-specific, genre feeds and more soon.

## jam.coop in the news

We love hearing from you, so hit reply and tell us what you think about
jam.

Cheers,

The jam.coop team at Go Free Range.
