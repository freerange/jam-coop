Hello!

Thank you for signing up at jam.coop to find out more about our new
co-operative music platform. We thought we'd give you an update on
where we've got to and how you can get involved.

** What is jam.coop? **

jam.coop is a co-operatively owned platform for musicians to connect
with and sell their music to their supporters. We wrote more about
this and answered some common questions at https://jam.coop/about

** What are you working on? **

So far we've onboarded a few artists. You can take a look at their
pages, listen to their music and purchase digital downloads of their
releases starting at https://jam.coop/artists. We'd love to hear what
you think about our service so far. Hit reply to this email to share
your thoughts.

Our next step is to add some more artists so that we can "launch" with
a homepage show-casing a variety of music. That's where you can help:

** How can I get involved? **

Are you an artist? If you already have music on bandcamp or another
service and would like to sell it through jam.coop, hit reply, tell us
a bit about yourself and we'll get you started.

Do you run a label? We'd love to help you sell your music on jam.coop
and learn more about the features you need to do so. Hit reply, let us
know what you need and we'll get right back to you.

Do you love supporting artists? Have a listen to some of the lovely
music we have on jam already and keep an eye out for more. You can
tell your favourite artists about us to - they can reach us any time
at contact@jam.coop.

Thank you so much for your interest so far. We'd love to hear from you
so reply to this email to share your thoughts.

We'll be in touch again soon,

Bye for now,

Chris and the jam.coop team at Go Free Range.
