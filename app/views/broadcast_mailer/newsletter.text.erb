Hello!

Thank you for signing up to find out more about jam.coop. Here's an
update on where we've got to and how you can get involved.

** What is jam.coop? **

jam.coop is a co-operatively owned platform for musicians to connect
with and sell their music to their supporters. Owning it together
means we can rely on it for the long term and share in the profits
together. We've answered some common questions at jam.coop/about

** What are you working on? **

So far we've onboarded a few wonderful artists. You can take a look at
their pages, listen to their music and purchase digital downloads of
their releases by starting at jam.coop/artists. We'd love to hear any
feedback you have. Hit reply to this email to share your thoughts.

We want to add some more artists so that we can "launch" with a
homepage showcasing a variety of music. That's where you can help:

** How can I get involved? **

*** Are you an artist? ***

If you already have music on bandcamp or another service and would
like to sell it through jam.coop, hit reply, tell us a bit about
yourself and we'll get you started.

*** Do you run a label? ***

We'd love to help you sell your music on jam.coop and learn more about
the features you need to do so. Hit reply, let us know what you need
and we'll get right back to you.

*** Do you love supporting artists? ***

Have a listen to some of the music we have on jam already and keep an
eye out for more. You can tell your favourite artists about us to -
they can reach us any time at contact@jam.coop.

Thank you so much for your interest so far. We'd love to hear from you
so reply to this email to share your thoughts.

We'll be in touch again soon,

Chris and the jam.coop team at Go Free Range.
