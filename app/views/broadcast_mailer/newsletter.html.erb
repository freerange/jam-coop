      <p>Hello!</p>

      <p>Thank you for your continued support and interest
        in <a href="https://jam.coop">jam.coop</a>. We've got a few
        updates to share. Read on!</p>

      <h2>What is jam.coop?</h2>

      <p>jam.coop is a co-operatively owned platform for musicians to
        connect with and sell their music to their supporters. Owning
        it together means we can rely on it for the long term and
        share in the profits together. We've answered some common
        questions
        at <a href="https://jam.coop/about">jam.coop/about</a>.</p>

      <h2>Have a listen to some music!</h2>

      <p>jam.coop is about the music and creating a sustainable way
        for us to support our favourite musicians.</p>

      <p>There's loads of great music already on jam, here's a few of
      my favourites:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://jam.coop/artists/couleurves/albums/pas-pense">pas
        pens√© by couleurves</a> - a small, mellow collection of
        reworked ambient tracks. Beautiful combination of guitar and
        synths.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jam.coop/artists/cayce-crane/albums/withered-tree">Withered
        Tree by cayce crane</a> - an infectious groove inspired
        by a 70's film.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jam.coop/artists/helen-bell/albums/sun-scorched-songs-of-sorrow">Sun
        Scorched Songs of Sorrow by Helen Bell</a> - lovely English
        chamber folk exploring our relationship with the physical
        world.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As we enter a quieter period for many around the world,
      wherever this email finds you we hope you have a peaceful and
      relaxing break,</p>

      <p>Chris and the jam.coop team at Go Free Range.</p>
