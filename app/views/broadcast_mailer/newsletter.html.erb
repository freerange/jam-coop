      <p>Hello!</p>

      <p>Thank you for signing up at <a href="https://jam.coop">jam.coop</a>
        to find out more about our new co-operative music platform. We thought
        we'd give you an update on where we've got to and how you can get
        involved.</p>

      <h2>What is jam.coop?</h2>

      <p>jam.coop is a co-operatively owned platform for musicians to
        connect with and sell their music to their supporters. We wrote more
        about this and answered some common questions
        at <a href="https://jam.coop/about">jam.coop/about</a></p>

      <h2>What are you working on?</h2>

      <p>So far we've onboarded a few wonderful artists. You can take a look
        at their pages, listen to their music and purchase digital downloads
        of their releases by starting
        at <a href="https://jam.coop/artists">jam.coop/artists</a>. We'd love
        to hear what you think about our service so far. Hit reply to this
        email to share your thoughts.</p>

      <p>Our next step is to add some more artists so that we can "launch" with
        a homepage show-casing a variety of music. That's where you can help:</p>

      <h2>How can I get involved?</h2>

      <p><b>Are you an artist?</b> If you already have music on bandcamp or another
        service and would like to sell it through jam.coop, hit reply, tell us
        a bit about yourself and we'll get you started.</p>

      <p><b>Do you run a label?</b> We'd love to help you sell your music on jam.coop
        and learn more about the features you need to do so. Hit reply, let us
        know what you need and we'll get right back to you.</p>

      <p><b>Do you love supporting artists?</b> Have a listen to some of the lovely
        music we have on jam already and keep an eye out for more. You can
        tell your favourite artists about us to - they can reach us any time
        at <a href="mailto:contact@jam.coop">contact@jam.coop</a>.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for your interest so far. We'd love to hear from you
        so reply to this email to share your thoughts.</p>

      <p>We'll be in touch again soon,</p>

      <p>Chris and the jam.coop team at Go Free Range.</p>
